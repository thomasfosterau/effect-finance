/**
 * The Stripe client every resource module and capability layer runs on:
 * Distilled's generated operations (`@distilled.cloud/stripe`), run under the
 * request policy this package has always applied to Stripe.
 *
 * Distilled builds and sends each request (the bearer key from its
 * `Credentials`, Stripe's bracketed form encoding, the `Idempotency-Key` /
 * `Stripe-Account` / `Stripe-Version` headers from `withRequestOptions`) and
 * reads the response, over `effect/http`'s `HttpClient`: no Node API and no
 * SDK, so it runs in a Cloudflare Worker (with `nodejs_compat`, since
 * Distilled reads `process.env` on every request) — provide
 * `FetchHttpClient.layer` in production, or a stubbed `FetchHttpClient.Fetch`
 * in tests. Around every operation {@link StripeHttp.call}:
 *
 * - **pins `Stripe-Version`** to {@link DISTILLED_API_VERSION}, the version
 *   Distilled's schemas are generated from, unless configured
 *   ({@link StripeHttpConfig.apiVersion}) or overridden for one call
 *   ({@link RequestOptions.apiVersion}). Distilled sends the header only when
 *   asked, and otherwise the account's dashboard default would decide the
 *   wire shape;
 * - **sends a `DELETE`'s params in the query string**, as the Stripe SDKs
 *   do (`Subscription.cancel(id, { invoice_now: true })`), where Distilled
 *   would form-encode them into a body;
 * - **pins lenient response validation**, so a response is never refused
 *   over a field nobody reads: Distilled's schemas mark fields required that
 *   a response at an older configured `apiVersion` lacks. The capability
 *   layers decode the fields they map instead; the resource modules return
 *   the response as Stripe sent it;
 * - **owns retries**: Distilled's are switched off, and an attempt that failed
 *   to connect, or answered `409` / `5xx` (as `Stripe-Should-Retry` allows),
 *   is retried with the SDK's backoff, reusing one `Idempotency-Key` across
 *   the attempts of a `POST`;
 * - **times out** each attempt and **refuses redirects**, which would replay
 *   the `Authorization` header to whatever host they named;
 * - **classifies failures** onto the neutral {@link PaymentsError} channel with
 *   the package's one Stripe error mapping. Distilled's error classes carry
 *   neither the HTTP status (which decides 401, 403 and 429 whatever the body
 *   says) nor the whole vendor error object, so the client watches the
 *   response through the `HttpClient` it hands Distilled and classifies that.
 *   A failure with no response behind it is a connection failure
 *   (`PaymentNetworkError`), or a Distilled error mapped to
 *   `PaymentProviderError` by its tag.
 *
 * The key stays a `Redacted` until Distilled sets the header; a connection
 * failure's `cause` is the underlying error, never the request that carries
 * the header.
