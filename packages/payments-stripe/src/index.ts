/**
 * `@thomasfosterau/effect-payments-stripe`
 *
 * The Stripe implementation of the vendor-neutral
 * `@thomasfosterau/effect-payments` core. It provides:
 *
 * - **`StripePayments`** — `Layer`s that implement every neutral capability
 *   (including `CheckoutSessions` and `BillingPortalSessions`) over
 *   Distilled's Stripe operations (`@distilled.cloud/stripe`), with a pinned
 *   `Stripe-Version`, the SDK's retry policy and Stripe's failures mapped onto
 *   the neutral errors, plus the `layer` / `layerFromEnv` / `layerConfig`
 *   bundles that build every capability from configuration.
 * - **`StripeHttp`** — the client the resource modules run on: Distilled's
 *   operations under the same request policy as the capabilities, over
 *   `effect/http`'s `HttpClient`, with no Node API and no SDK.
 * - **Raw resource modules** (`Customer`, `Invoice`, `Charge`, `Treasury`, …) —
 *   the Stripe escape hatch for what the neutral capabilities do not cover:
 *   every Distilled operation on each resource, typed with Distilled's
 *   declarations and wrapped with the pinned `Stripe-Version` and
 *   {@link RequestOptions}.
 * - **`Webhook`** — the WebCrypto webhook verifier, and the SDK-based one for
 *   a program that provides its own `stripe` client.
 *
 * This entry point re-exports every resource module, so its declarations
 * reach Distilled's whole operations module (about 7.5 MB); a program that
 * needs one resource imports its subpath (or only `StripePayments`, whose
 * declarations stay small).
 *
 * This is the payments analogue of Effect's AI modules: one abstraction, one
 * package per provider, with provider-specific APIs still exposed.
 *
 * See `StripePayments.layer` for an example of running a neutral program on Stripe.
