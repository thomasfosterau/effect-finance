/**
 * Conversion between the neutral minor-unit amounts and the major-unit decimal
 * amounts Airwallex uses on the wire.
 *
 * The neutral core represents money in the smallest currency unit (e.g.
 * cents). Airwallex represents money in major units (e.g. `20.5`), sent and
 * received as JSON **numbers**. Neither direction scales with float
 * arithmetic:
 *
 * - **Parse.** By the time a response amount reaches the decoder, `JSON.parse`
 *   has already rounded its wire text to the nearest double; the text itself
 *   is gone. The amount is read from that double's shortest decimal form,
 *   `String(n)`, including exponent notation such as `1e-7` or `1.5e+21`, and
 *   scaled with integer (`BigInt`) arithmetic. It is rejected, not rounded,
 *   when that form has more fraction digits than the currency allows, when it
 *   is beyond the safe-integer range in minor units, or when the double is
 *   **ambiguous**: some decimal at least half a minor unit away (e.g.
 *   `45035996273704.955` USD) rounds to the same double, so the wire amount
 *   cannot be told apart from a different one. An accepted amount is exact
 *   whenever its wire text has no more fraction digits than the currency
 *   allows. Excess digits that change the value by less than the double can
 *   resolve (e.g. `0.30000000000000001`) are undetectable in principle: they
 *   parse to the same double as the amount without them.
 * - **Format.** A request amount must be a non-negative safe integer in minor
 *   units. Its decimal is built as a string and sent as the number whose JSON
 *   text is exactly that decimal, and only when that number also parses back
 *   to the same amount by the rules above. An amount with no such number (a
 *   decimal with more significant digits than a double keeps, or an ambiguous
 *   double) fails before anything is sent, so every amount this module sends
 *   is one it can read back from Airwallex's echo.
