/**
 * The client the capability layers (`PayPalPayments`) reach PayPal through:
 * Distilled's generated operations (`@distilled.cloud/paypal`), run under the
 * request policy below (the one the package's hand-written REST client
 * applied before #146 removed it).
 *
 * Distilled builds and sends each request (the URI template and its path ids,
 * the query string, the JSON body, the `PayPal-Request-Id` header of a write)
 * with the access token and base URL its `Credentials` resolve to, and reads
 * the response. Around every operation this module:
 *
 * - **authenticates from the session** (`internal/auth.ts`): the token comes
 *   from the shared OAuth login and its cache, never from Distilled's
 *   `CredentialsFromEnv`, and a 401 forgets the token that request used;
 * - **sends `Content-Type: application/json` and `Accept: application/json`
 *   on every request**: Distilled sends no body (and so no content type) on
 *   a `POST` without body members, and PayPal answers a bodyless
 *   `POST /v1/billing/plans/{id}/activate` without one with 415;
 * - **pins lenient response validation**, so a response is never refused over
 *   a field this package does not read; the capability layers decode the
 *   fields they map instead;
 * - **switches Distilled's retries off**: it never repeats a request, so a
 *   write is retried only by its caller, with the `PayPal-Request-Id` it
 *   chose;
 * - **times out** each request (default 80 s, not including the login);
 * - **classifies failures** onto the neutral {@link PaymentsError} channel
 *   from the response's status and PayPal's error body. Distilled's error
 *   classes keep neither the status nor the whole vendor body, so the client
 *   watches the response through the `HttpClient` it hands Distilled and
 *   classifies that with `handlePayPalError`. A failure with no response
 *   behind it is a connection failure ({@link PaymentNetworkError}), or a
 *   Distilled error mapped to {@link PaymentProviderError} by its tag.
 *
 * The token is a `Redacted` until Distilled sets the header; a connection
 * failure keeps only the underlying cause, never the request that carries it.
