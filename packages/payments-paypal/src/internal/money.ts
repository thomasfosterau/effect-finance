/**
 * Conversion between the neutral minor-unit amounts and the major-unit decimal
 * *strings* PayPal uses on the wire (e.g. `"10.00"`).
 *
 * Both directions use integer (string / `BigInt`) arithmetic, never a float,
 * so an amount is exact across the whole safe-integer range and a value with
 * more fraction digits than its currency allows is rejected instead of being
 * silently rounded.
 *
 * The number of fraction digits per currency follows PayPal's "Currency codes"
 * reference (https://developer.paypal.com/api/rest/reference/currency-codes/)
 * and its `Money` object ("an integer for currencies like `JPY` that are not
 * typically fractional; a decimal fraction for currencies like `TND` that are
 * subdivided into thousandths"), which defers to ISO 4217 except where PayPal
 * says otherwise. It is deliberately PayPal's table, not Stripe's: PayPal
 * rejects decimals on `HUF` and `TWD`, which ISO 4217 (and Stripe) give two.
