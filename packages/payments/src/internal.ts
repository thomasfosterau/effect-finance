/**
 * Helpers shared by the provider packages in this repository.
 *
 * **Internal, and exempt from semver.** This subpath exists only so the
 * providers in this repository can share code, since a provider may import
 * nothing but this package. It is not part of the public API: its exports can
 * change or disappear in any release, minor and patch included. Do not import
 * it from application code.
 *
 * It holds these vendor-neutral pieces:
 *
 * - {@link shareLogin}: one in-flight token login shared by every caller that
 *   needs a token while it runs.
 * - The integer money core: {@link exponentFrom}, {@link scaleToMinor}, {@link parseDecimal},
 *   {@link decimalText}, {@link formatDecimal} and {@link checkMinorUnits}.
 *   Everything is parameterised by a fraction-digit count, so the per-currency
 *   exponent tables and the wire adapters stay in each provider.
 * - The token-login plumbing of an OAuth-style provider: {@link tokenCache},
 *   {@link send} (with {@link networkError} and {@link timedOut}),
 *   {@link timeoutOf}, {@link isAbsoluteHttpUrl} and {@link isOk}. Each takes
 *   the provider's name for its messages; the login request, its response
 *   schema and the vendor error mapping stay in each provider.
 * - The request helpers of a provider built over a generated operation
 *   client: {@link omitUndefined}, {@link checkId}, {@link stringField},
 *   {@link observeResponses} and {@link rejectedError}. None names a vendor or
 *   a client library: each provider keeps its own client wiring, retry and
 *   validation policy, and error classification.
 * - The response handling of a REST provider: {@link responseDecoder} (a
 *   wire body decoded and mapped onto a neutral value), {@link epochSecondsOf}
 *   (an ISO-8601 timestamp as the neutral Unix seconds) and
 *   {@link errorFromStatus} (an HTTP error status as the neutral error). Each
 *   provider keeps its wire schemas, its status spellings and the reading of
 *   its own error body.
