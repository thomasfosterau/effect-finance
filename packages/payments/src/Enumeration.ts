/**
 * Lenient provider enumerations: a neutral literal set plus a tagged catch-all.
 *
 * A provider can add a value to one of its enumerations (a payment status, a
 * billing interval) at any time. A neutral enumeration is therefore not a
 * closed literal set but `Known | Other`: the literals this library models,
 * plus {@link Other} carrying the raw string a provider sent that it does not
 * model. An unrecognised value then never fails the decode of a whole object
 * or list page, and the exact value stays available to the caller.
 *
 * Every neutral enumeration uses this one shape. The known literals stay bare
 * strings (`"succeeded"`), so existing code comparing against them keeps
 * working; only an exhaustive match must now also handle `Other`.
 *
