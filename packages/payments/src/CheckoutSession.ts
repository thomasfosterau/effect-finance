/**
 * Vendor-neutral hosted checkout.
 *
 * A checkout session is a payment page the provider hosts: the program creates
 * one for a customer and a set of prices, then redirects the buyer to its
 * {@link CheckoutSession.url}. The provider collects payment details and sends
 * the buyer back to `successUrl` or `cancelUrl`; the outcome arrives through the
 * provider's webhooks, not through this call.
 *
 * **No amount is ever an input.** Line items name price ids, so what the buyer
 * pays is whatever the provider's price says, and a client cannot choose it.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { Effect } from "effect";
 * import * as CheckoutSession from "@thomasfosterau/effect-payments/CheckoutSession";
 *
 * const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
 *   const session = yield* CheckoutSession.create({
 *     mode: "subscription",
 *     customer: "cus_123",
 *     lineItems: [{ price: "price_monthly" }],
 *     successUrl: "https://example.com/billing?checkout=success",
 *     cancelUrl: "https://example.com/pricing",
 *   });
 *   return session.url; // redirect the buyer here
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * @module
