/**
 * The consumer type-check cost of #146: Distilled's generated operation
 * modules are large declaration files (`@distilled.cloud/stripe` puts every
 * Stripe operation in one of about 7.5 MB; `@distilled.cloud/paypal`'s
 * Orders module alone is about 0.8 MB), and a consumer whose declarations
 * reach one type-checks all of it. `StripePayments`, `StripeHttp`, `Webhook`
 * and `PayPalPayments` run on those operations but name only Distilled's
 * `Credentials` (each its own small subpath) in their declarations, so a
 * program on the neutral capabilities never pays for them.
 *
 * The Stripe resource modules (`./Customer`, `./Invoice`, …) are re-exports of
 * Distilled's operations and types, so their declarations do name the
 * operations module, by design: the cost a consumer pays for the escape
 * hatch it imports. Each must name it (a module typed by anything else would
 * have stopped re-exporting Distilled), and nothing else of Distilled's but
 * the light subpath.
 *
 * Walks the `.d.ts` graph of each package's `dist/` from every published
 * entry point (following `import … from`, `export … from` and `import("…")`
 * types into the shared declaration chunks) and fails on a declaration that
 * names a `@distilled.cloud/*` module its entry may not. Run by this
 * package's `check` task against the fresh `dist/` its build edges produce.
 * Plain Node: nothing here is Effect code.
