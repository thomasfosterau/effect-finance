/**
 * The emitted-bundle half of #39's "the `stripe` SDK is optional" guarantee
 * (the source half is `packages/payments-stripe/tests/sdkOptional.test.ts`).
 *
 * Walks the runtime import graph of `packages/payments-stripe/dist/` from
 * every published entry point and fails if any entry can reach `stripe` —
 * through a static `import` / `export … from`, a bare `import "…"`, a dynamic
 * `import("…")` or a `require("…")`, in the entry or in any chunk it pulls in.
 * Since #146 dropped the `./Stripe` SDK transport, no entry loads it: the
 * optional peer only types the SDK-based webhook verifier. A Worker bundle
 * built from any entry therefore never contains the SDK.
 *
 * Run by this package's `check` task after the type check, against the fresh
 * `dist/` its build edges produce. Plain Node: nothing here is Effect code.
