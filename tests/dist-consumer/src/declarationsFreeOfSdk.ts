/**
 * The declaration half of the optional `stripe` peer (#56, #146): no Stripe
 * declaration but the webhook verifier's may need the `stripe` package to
 * type-check in a consumer. Every resource module is typed with Distilled's
 * declarations; only `Webhook` (the SDK-based `constructEvent*` and its
 * `StripeService`) names `stripe`, and the root barrel, which re-exports it.
 *
 * Walks the `.d.ts` graph of `packages/payments-stripe/dist/` from every
 * published entry point (following `import … from`, `export … from` and
 * `import("…")` types into the shared declaration chunks) and fails if any
 * declaration reachable from one names `stripe`. Run by this package's
 * `check` task against the fresh `dist/` its build edges produce. Plain Node:
 * nothing here is Effect code.
